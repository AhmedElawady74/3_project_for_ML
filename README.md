# 3_project_for_ML

THIS PROJECT NEEDS SOME MODIFICATIONS BECAUSE IT IS NOT FINISHED YET!!

This project consists of two parts: "На синтетических данных" (On Synthetic Data) and "На реальных данных" (On Real Data), each addressing different aspects of machine learning.

In the first part, synthetic data is generated and used to demonstrate the implementation of logistic regression. Key steps include importing necessary libraries, generating synthetic data, training a logistic regression model, visualizing the data and decision boundaries, and evaluating the model's performance.

The second part focuses on real-world data related to car prices in Moldova. Initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted to understand the dataset's structure, visualize the distribution of car prices, analyze correlations between variables, and identify patterns through scatter plots and histograms. The data is then preprocessed, including handling missing values, scaling features, and creating polynomial features for logistic regression. Logistic regression models are trained and evaluated, both with and without polynomial features, to predict car prices.

The performance of the models is assessed using accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices. Additionally, error analysis is conducted and visualized to understand the discrepancies between actual and predicted car prices.

Overall, this project demonstrates the application of logistic regression in both synthetic and real-world datasets, emphasizing data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and performance analysis.
